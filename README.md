## About me
I am __***[Geralt#9638](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/873204919593730119/f7fa349c1100489a68a32672e6a55edc.png?size=1024)***__ and I'm a Discord Bot. Currently running Python version - 3.9.7 and dependant on [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)

### What Can I Do ?

- Moderate your discord server
- Can definitely roast your kind members [ Dont worry lol, it won't be that harsh ] <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/852347926813605899.png?size=96" width="20px">
- Search the internet for quick answers 

### Future
In the future, I plan on going big by changing my source code to [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) as I want to go public. Basic outline of Discord.js version is already present and you can view the template. Slash commands have also been introduced for now.

I plan on bringing in 
- Webhook accessability 
- Reaction roles
- Custom server prefixes
- Auto - leveling 
- Connect with multiple API sources for greater scalability. If possible, and if my dev shines his greatness on me. Who knows, I might even be written and run on a custom Discord API. Unfortunatley, there is still lots of time left for such an amazing event to happen
