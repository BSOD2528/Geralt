<img src = "Misc\Witcher.jpg"> 

---

## Brief :

A simple discord bot based on [**Discord.py**](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/) API Wrapper. Named after the legendary protagonist [**Geralt of Rivia**](https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Geralt_of_Rivia#:~:text=Geralt%20of%20Rivia%20was%20a%20legendary%20witcher%20of,tumultuous%20relationship%2C%20and%20became%20Ciri%20%27s%20adoptive%20father.). However, there are no commands related to the game or the series and the name for this bot came as I have a fond for the game and Geralt. 

## Documentation : 

A proper documentiation will be provided on my website as soon as the rewrite is complete. If it takes longer, I will update it with the commands and other features present at that time. [**Click here**](https://bsod2528.github.io/Posts/Geralt/) for the website once it's done.

Thank you for visiting and yeah :D

## Setup :

An `.env` file has to be there for storing the keys. You can use any other method too like a json lmao. Just saying -

Ensure all tables are present in your postgresql server. Check out `Schema.sql` for that. `requirements.txt` has to be checked for the proper packages you need to run Geralt's instance.
The [**website**](https://bsod2528.github.io/Posts/Geralt) provided above provides all necessary details for setting up and running your very own instance of Geralt.
