---

## Brief :

A simple discord bot based on [**Disnake**](https://disnake.dev/) API Wrapper which is a fork from the parent library [**Discord.py**](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/). Named after the legendary protagonist [**Geralt of Rivia**](https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Geralt_of_Rivia#:~:text=Geralt%20of%20Rivia%20was%20a%20legendary%20witcher%20of,tumultuous%20relationship%2C%20and%20became%20Ciri%20%27s%20adoptive%20father.). However, there are no commands related to the game or the series and the name for this bot came as I have a fond for the game and Geralt. 


## Disclaimer :

He is currently under a rewrite as the old version is to messy and poor for maximum utilisation of resources. The old version is deprecated and yeah .__.

However, if you are interested in checking out the old version, [**click here**](https://github.com/BSOD2528/Geralt/tree/stellar-v0.1) of the code.

## Documentation : 

A proper documentiation will be provided on my website as soon as the rewrite is complete. If it takes longer, I will update it with the commands and other features present at that time. [**Click here**](https://bsod2528.github.io/Posts/Geralt/) for the website once it's done.

Thank you for visiting and yeah :D
